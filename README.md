- 👋 Hi, I’m Liam
- 👀 I’m interested in all forms of development, but I'm mainly focused on web tech at the moment
- 🌱 I’m mainly working with Go at the moment, but carry on with VueJS and other front end stuff. I have been learning a bit of V (vlang) which has been fun for UI based things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me drop me a line at liam.pugh.009@gmail.com
